# Week 3 Challenges

1. Change the [`football_players_example`](../week3/football_players_example) demonstrated in lectures in week 3 to search for clubs is case-insensitive (currently it is case sensitive).

2. Change the [`football_players_example`](../week3/football_players_example) demonstrated in lectures in week 3 to search for clubs *without* the text entered into the search box. So if one entered "United", it would show all clubs without "United" in the name. That is, the search query is negated. 

3. Change the [`football_players_example`](../week3/football_players_example) so that the field is to search for a player's name. Note though, that a player's name is in two fields in the database. A player needs to be in the search results matches their firstname OR their surname.
