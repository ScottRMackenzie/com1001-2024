# Project FAQ

Please note that the [project brief](Spring-Project-Brief.md) is the definitive guide - I have added content here to clarify questions that have been asked (initially in previous years). 
If there appear to be any conflicts - then the project brief wins.

This is a *living* document. Newer Questions will be added at the top, so if you have read this once, then you should only need to check the first questions.


### Which browser should we use?

This should not affect your application. However, we will use Chrome for marking.


### What about Mobile (or Desktop)?

Your system must run and be demonstrated on a Desktop browser. Please avoid any browser specifics - we will mostly be using Chrome to view your system.


### How many marks are there for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?

We will only be marking Ruby code. That said, HTML and CSS are also needed, of course, and the more effort you put in to produce a nicer-looking website, the better a demonstration you will be able to do for your client. Whether you should be using JavaScript or not is addressed in the answer to a question below.


### Is there any restriction on the use of alternative/additional software and development environments (e.g. JavaScript, Java, framework XXX, etc.)?

You must be using Ruby and Sinatra on Codio, i.e. what is taught in lectures. If you do anything else, you may earn zero marks for some of your work. We will only be marking Ruby code. You will have to use HTML. CSS is also expected (within reason). You may use some Javascript - but it will not be marked. 

It is VERY IMPORTANT to avoid using Javascript instead of doing things in Ruby. For example, if you show sorted tables, then Ruby and Sinatra must be used for sorting, not Javascript.

However, Javascript may help you produce a better looking demonstration for your client.

If in doubt - you should be able to disable Javascript in the browser and still show your application working.

Finally, note that your system must deploy (according to your instructions) and run on Codio.


### Are we supposed to store passwords in the database in plain text, or use some more secure method?

Using a secure method that will be discussed in lectures. 


### Can we use the gem "[insert name]" in our project?

We don't object to you using gems other than those mentioned or used in class. But bear in mind these gems might not be needed once all the course material has been covered in lectures. For example, if the gem does some database handling that the Sequel gem does, you should use the Sequel gem as instructed in lectures.

With that in mind, it's probably best if you wait until all the lectures have concluded before you decide what additional gems you would like to include. We will have covered everything you need in class, so it's likely additional gems would only be useful for polishing/finishing touches.


### If we decide to take a lateness penalty, what do we need to do?

When you submit your Report, this will be taken as when you have finished. If you submit and very quicky realise you have made a mistake, then you must inform your Team Supervisor to avoid the wrong version being marked. Note that the markers will use the report submission date/time to access your code repository and the standard department lateness penalty will apply (please see the Student Handbook).


### When will the peer review be able for us to submit?

The peer review will be available after week 11 (Iteration 2) - we will let you know when it is available - please look out for an email.


### If a team member submits our code late, can the penalty only apply to them?

No - it is teamwork and you will all have the same penalty. We recommend that teams watch while one of you submits the last piece of work - and/or use Gitlab to check it has been submitted (and check the contents are correct).


### Do we have to give a presentation?

You are giving a demonstration to your Team Supervisor, not a presentation. This means showing how your system works and is useful - not presenting how it works. 


### What if we have a smaller team?

As a guide, we consider the full size of teams with 6 or fewer team members when marking. Where teams have absent members, we will consider this based on peer review and record of attendance. Further, peer review is the route to give feedback on individual contributions.


### What if one of our team members isn't responding?

Please keep inviting them. When you are asked to peer review - do so taking into account their contribution this semester. Please also let your Team Supervisor know - we keep notes on teams identifying absent students. Note that team meeting attendance is recorded.


### Can we have a Team extension?

This is extremely unlikely, since individual extensions cannot be applied to a team. You should compensate for any missing members and then let your Team Supervisor know if your team was then much smaller than expected. Note that attendance at the Project Demonstration is recorded.


### What if we (have to) submit the GitLab late?

Firstly, you must inform your Team Supervisor, who is also your main marker. If you do not, then your older code will be marked. Where a newer submission needs to be marked, standard penalties will apply. If you believe you have a legitimate reason for the delay, then again, please inform your Team Supervisor, who will contact me. You may also email me ([Donghwan Shin](mailto:d.shin@sheffield.ac.uk)) - please make sure you state the issue and your team number.


### How can we send an email from Ruby?

Due to the security on Codio, you cannot reliably send emails, so this should not be a requirement of your project. (If this is absolutely essential, then you should indicate that an email would have been sent, e.g. by showing a representative page showing the email details that would have been sent.)


### Should we use branches?

It is up to you - our experience is that having multiple branches has caused issues for some teams when merging branches. You might regard this as a useful learning experience - or you might not. You must (at least) have a main branch, of course - this is the branch we will view for marking.


### Can teams extend reports they produced last semester?

No - you are not allowed to resubmit work you have already been awarded marks for. Check the project brief - which asks you to identify any changes from your previous report.


### Can we create everything in Iteration 1 and then improve it in Iteration 2?

You will be marked down if you do. Part of the assignment requirement is to show prioritisation. You should fully develop your Iteration 1 stories. Iteration 2 stories should therefore be 'extras' to the iteration1 stories.

e.g. Logging in iteration 1. Resetting password could be put in iteration 2. Creating a new user could in theory be put in iteration 2 - but is very likely to be needed in iteration 1. Suspending users could be in iteration 2. Warning users they are suspended could be in iteration 1 - by using unit testing to suspend them and test that suspended login isn't allowed. The interface for the admin could be added later.

I would recommend you split your stories based on dependencies and priorities to fit them into iteration 1 or later - then get all the iteration 1 done first. Including automated tests :)


### Do we have to submit our test files?

Your test files should be in your repository - where we will find them (hopefully). Don't forget to document them in the report.

You should include a README.md that includes deployment (and maybe location) instructions, so that should say how to run your tests and see results.


### Do we submit the entire website? Or do we just send the separate files?

We will view your GitLab repository - mostly at the end of iteration 2 - so everything will be visible there.


### Where can we ask more questions?

Please use the Discussion Board/Forum. Only if the question is confidential/private, then please contact your Team Supervisor or myself (Donghwan).


### There is no exam in COM1001, right?

Correct - there is no exam for COM1001. Please see the project brief and schedule document for details.


### What if the code is written by several group members but only pushed by one group member?

This will affect your individual marks, since you are meant to be using Gitlab for team working - this would count against your doing so. Also note that peer review will have less evidence of contributions.

I recommend you start off with your README.md, in your Gitlab repository, and work from there. Create documents for testing, etc. and check them into Gitlab as well.
