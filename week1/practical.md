# Week 1 Practical: Getting Everything Setup

We'll be using this session to ensure each individual and team has everything
they need to get started on the team project. 

You'll need to sit in your teams as per the seating plan for your room:

* **Teams 1-26** are in **Computer Room 3**, and need to sit
 according to the [seating plan for CR3](../misc/CR3-seating-plan.pdf).
* **Teams 27-53** are in  **Computer Room 5**, and need to sit according to the
  [seating plan for CR5](../misc/CR5-seating-plan.pdf).

## Task 1. Meet Your Demonstrator

Teams are organised into "zones". Each zone has a specific demonstrator
according to the plan. **Your first task is to identify this person, and introduce
your team to them.***

## Task 2. Ensure Everyone's Codio is Setup

Everyone should have done this already, but maybe certain individuals didn't get
the memo and/or experienced problems. If a team member is yet to set up their
Codio according to the [Getting Started](../getting-started) instructions, make
sure they have done now. 

## Task 3. Setting up Slack for Your Team

Throughout the rest of the team project, you will be using Slack. Slack
is a group messaging app that was originally designed for developers
collaborating on different parts of a software application. Slack splits
conversation topics into different "channels". Channels can be
hooked up to different services so that the team can be notified of events such
as pushes to the shared repository, or calendar events (e.g., important team
meetings).

While there are other messaging apps available – and maybe you are already using
one for your team – this is the method you need to be using this semester,
because assessing the quality of your communication over Slack is one way in
which we will be assessing you. Even if you're ahead of the game and you already
have a Slack team, you still need to create a new one as detailed below,
following the naming scheme below.

Here, we'll be using Slack in its web browser form. However, you're
strongly encouraged to download the application from the Slack website and
install it on your laptop, and download the app to your mobile device. This way
you can stay in touch with your team, wherever you are. Notifications will go
straight to your phone, keeping you up to date with the status of the project.
In case you're wondering, notifications can be "snoozed" when you're in other
teaching sessions or in bed at night... Slack is also sensitive to people
working in different timezones, and will politely tell you if another person is
outside of their working hours (you can set your timezone, if it is incorrect,
by editing your profile).

To do this you'll need to get it set up correctly, so read the next section
carefully, and follow all of its instructions. 

### The Steps You Need to Follow... 

To start using Slack, you'll need to set up a Slack "team", which is Slack's
term used to describe a particular group's set of private chat rooms: 

1. Nominate **one** person in your team to do the initial setting up of the
team. It needs to be one person, otherwise you'll potentially end up with
multiple Slack teams rather than just one. This person needs to perform the
following steps: 

    a. Go to https://slack.com/get-started.

    b. Enter your **University** email address in the text box, and click "Continue".

    c. Check your email for the code, and enter it on the web page, as
    instructed. 
    
    d. On the next page, click "Create a Workspace". 

    e. On the next page, entitled "What's the name of your company or team", set
    the team name to "ise24team**XX**" where **XX** is your two-digit team
    number (e.g., "ise24team01". Note the two digits — if your team number
    is between 1-9, you'll need to add a leading zero. (You can leave the "Let
    anyone with a ``@sheffield.ac.uk`` email address join this workspace"
    tickbox checked.)
    
    f. The person setting up the Slack team needs to add their name and an
    optional profile picture on the next screen. 

    g. On the next page, invite all of your teammates by entering their email
    addresses. (You can also add members later, so don't worry if you don't have
    them all to hand.)
    
    h. On the next page, entitled "What's your team working on right now", enter
    "Practical Sessions". (This will create your first "channel".)

    i. Invite your **supervisor** to your team. This is important, otherwise we
    will not be able to assess you! Your supervisor and their email address can
    be found in the (../getting-started/0-2-project-intro.pdf)[slides about the team project from the lecture in week 1].
    Supervisors will check in on your team from time to time on Slack, just to
    check everyone's engaged and you're all getting along... To do this, click
    the "Add coworkers button", under the list of names to the left of the
    screen. You can also add teammates via this method. 

    j. Invite your **demonstrator** to your team. Demonstrators may be able to 
    help you outside of class (although this cannot be guaranteed, since they 
    also have deadlines, just like yourselves). You will need to ask them their 
    email address in order to do this! 

2. If you need help with any of the above steps, ask your
demonstrator! They should be your first port of call in case of
problems during the lab sessions. For questions outside of labs, consult 
the [Technical FAQ](../technical-FAQ.md)!

3. Your team's messaging service will now be available at
   https://ise24teamXX.slack.com. 

4. Each team member should respond to their invitation to join the team, via
their email. 

5. Everyone in the team should sign into your team and edit their profile and
enter their full name, so that it is displayed in the left-hand pane of the
Slack window. **NB: Use your proper name** — don't use nicknames, usernames for
other services or anything else that could prevent the teaching team identifying
who you are on Slack. Remember, Slack usage is one way in which your team will
be assessed.

### Getting the Most out of Slack

Now your team is set up on Slack, start playing around with its features. Try
setting up a few "channels". You could have ones for the development of
different features in your application, for example, or channels for different
activities. You can do this by clicking "Add Channels" in the lefthand sidebar.

You can alert certain people to a message by including their username  prefixing
with the `@` symbol (a bit like Twitter, for example `@andrewstratton Have you
pushed the code yet?`. Everyone in a channel can be alerted with `@channel`
(e.g, `@channel Hi everyone!`).

If you set up channels, ensure that your supervisor has been added to them,
otherwise your chats will be invisible to them, defeating the point of including
them in your Slack team in the first place. (When it comes to marking, we won't
be searching for channels you may or may not have created that you didn't add us
to, so you won't get any marks that might have been assigned.)

### Customising Slack and Adding Useful Features

If you click the arrow down icon on your team name in the Slack window, and
go to "Settings & administration", then "Manage apps", then "Browse" in the
top right corner; you can find lots of apps to plug into Slack to make it
more useful to your team. Some examples include the GSuite apps, which can
be used to integrate Google apps, including Google Calendar, which will
alert you to events in your calendar. For example, you could set up a
Google Calendar for your team to schedule your team's activities (e.g.,
meetings), and be automatically notified of impending events via Slack.

If you go back and click the down arrow again, and this time select
"Customize ..." under "Settings & administration", you can customize other
aspects of Slack — like creating your own emojis, change loading messages
etc.

## Task 4. 

If you've not completed [week 1's challenges](./challenges.md)
do these tasks with any time remaining in the class.
